# Frontend:
When a user enters their credentials (email and password) and clicks the "Sign in" button, the frontend (JavaScript) collects the data.
It might validate the input (e.g., check if the email format is correct) before sending it to the backend server.
It ensures that the user experience is smooth and interactive, like showing error messages if fields are empty or credentials are incorrect.
# Backend:
When the user submits their credentials, the backend server receives the request .
 the server check  the login request and checks the database to see if the entered email/phone and password match a registered user.
# Database :
he backend connects to the database to check the stored user data. The database contains usersâ€™ hashed and other relevant information.
If the user exists, the backend compares the entered password with the stored hashed password.
If the credentials are correct, the server sent back to the frontend to keep the user logged in.
